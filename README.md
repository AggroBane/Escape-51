# Escape-51
LORE: You are an alien that crashed on the Earth and got captured by the Area 51, your goal is to escape this zone as fast as possible

NOTE: I know that the hitbox of the alien is a little bit too large, which may result in a lot of rage. But if you look closely, the hitbox end right after the alien's antenna, so you just got to be careful ;)

P.S: This was my first Java game, last update was in 2017, so there is a lot of optimization to do.
